# EEG-based-Drowsiness-Detection
 
This project aims at using EEG signals to determine the stage of sleep. 
The data was obtained from PhysioNet's Sleep-EDF dataset. 
Further, the annotation files were prepared using a toolbox called EDFBrowser. This annotation file as well the original EDF signal is fed
into a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) as a part of training.
